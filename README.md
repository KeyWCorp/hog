'''
# To begin the progam:
#	Clone Hog from the Gitlab repository

#	cd into the 'hog' directory
#	npm install - if asked to make a selection, choose the version that is 'required by hog'
#	bower install - if asked to make a selection, choose the verion that is 'required by hog'

# 	Install Pig, 'brew install pig' if you have a mac

#	brew install apache piglatin

#	There are 2 files in the externals/ directory (ace.js and mode-pi_latin.js). Those need to be copied 
#	into bower_components/ace_builds/src-min-noconflicts/ directory

#	Open a second terminal, navigate to the hog/ directory and run 'gulp'

# A tab in your browser will automatically open to 'localhost:9000' with the script
# running. We find the program runs best using a Chrome web browser.
