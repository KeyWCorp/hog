# To begin the progam:
```
Clone Hog from the Gitlab repository

cd into the 'hog' directory
npm install - if asked to make a selection, choose the version that is 'required by hog'
bower install - if asked to make a selection, choose the verion that is 'required by hog'
```

Open a terminal and nagvigate to /hog/server/scripts/pig and run 'pig -x local'

Open a second terminal, navigate to the hog/ directory and run 'gulp'


A tab in your browser will automatically open to 'localhost:9000' with the script
running. We find the program runs best using a Chrome web browser.
